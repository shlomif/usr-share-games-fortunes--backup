Okay, blow jobs. Here's the secret: Few people actually enjoy giving blow jobs,
as blow jobs are hard, awkward, drool-inducing work. Sore jaws and stiff necks
are to be expected, and, as incentives go, a mouth full of come at the end of a
job well done isn't exactly stock options. But there are a couple of things you
can do to minimize your discomfort and hurry things along. Use your right hand
to make a fist around the base of your boyfriend's cock. This will limit how
much of his cock he can get in your mouth and provide him with additional
stimulation that will hopefully get him off quicker. At the same time, make a
fist around his scrotum with your left hand. He'll be less likely to make a
sudden move (like a throat-plugging thrust) if it might cost him his nuts. And,
finally, without loosening your grip on his balls, use the index finger of your
left hand to tickle the area behind his balls and before his asshole. Again,
he'll get off quicker. Finally, if you're feeling very tired or worn out or
sore, take a break.

"We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of

But the only thing that worried me was the ether. There is nothing more
irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge..."
