A Jewish Deduction

The Bible dictates that “Thou shalt not seethe [= cook] a kid [= young goat]
in his mother’s milk”. To avoid any possibility of breaking that regulation,
the Jewish tradition ruled that it also applies to female goats, to mature
goats, and to the meat and milk of two completely unrelated goats. It is also
forbidden to eat the meat with fresh milk, and it applies to beef and mutton
as well (including mixing the milk and meat of two different beasts). Finally,
chicken, which are incapable of milk production, may not be eaten along with
any mammal’s milk either.

We are fortunate that most mathematicians were not Jewish. Otherwise, it would
have been forbidden to divide by all numbers between -1 and 1.

switched the help systems of the upcoming Windows 98, as well as Microsoft
Visual C++ 5.0, to HTML a major step in advancing our project.

As a complementary step, some of the chief heads of our project suggested that
the Windows’ manuals themselves, as well as all of Microsoft’s ads, will be
designed in HTML and printed after being rendered by IE4. While this project
is in the preliminary and planning stages, we expect it to acquire a large
momentum soon.

Are you kidding?

CVS is not advanced as:

1. Microsoft Visual SourceSafe - the only sane choice for good data integrity
and portability.

2. tarballs/zip-files and patches. This one excels in convenience, and
robustness.

CVS is a very advanced version control system, however. I do wish that
Subversion (which is a VCS that I have to use against my will) was as good as
it is.

A few weeks ago, I’ve been to Freenode’s #perl, talking to merlyn and other
guys, when we got to discuss the Biblical "Tower of Babel Myth". As it turned
out, the commonly perceived interpretation was not the one most scholars find
as more sensible, which is the one we ended up being taught at Junior High
School.

What most people think is something like that:

<<<

The people spoke to each other in the same language, concentrated in one
place, and decided to build a tower high enough so they can reach God. God, a
small dwarf who lived in the sky, was afraid of the efforts of these people,
because he feared they’ll reach him. So he casted an 8th level Spell of
Language Fragmentation, caused these people to speak in different tongues, and
without being able to understand each other, they ended up spreading across
the Earth. God was relieved and returned to his dwarfish deeds, as dwarfs do.

No. 1 is true, naturally. No. 2 is not true - I know LISP but I prefer Perl.
Other like Python, etc. The reasons I don’t prefer LISP are:

1. The standards of Common LISP and Scheme don’t define anything practical.
2. LISP is at the moment incredibly verbose.
3. As Larry Wall noted, all LISP code comes in parenthesis and so it all looks
the same. (Perl is the exact opposite in this regard).
4. I cannot make heads nor tails of serious LISP code. Many LISPers create so
many macros and use them along with regular LISP code, so you keep having to
refer to the previous definitions, and make a lot of research to get you
started.

SICP Scheme is easy and fun. But serious LISP code can take too much time to
understand. OTOH, recently I had little problem reading the source code of
other Perl programmers, and extending it or fixing bugs. (likewise for
Python).

A few days ago I joined #mandriva on Freenode trying to get to the bottom of a

* One Thunderbird recommendation.

* Two Evolution recommendations.

* One Sylpheed Claws recommendation.

* One GMail recommendation.

The problem is that I wasn’t interested to learn about alternative E-mail
clients, and just wanted to get my problem solved. And in GMail’s case it was
completely out of the question due to my work’s constraints.

I recently had to figure out how to do something with wget: get everything
below a directory on the web-server, without following links to outside it. So
I logged in to FreeNode’s #debian channel, where there are many knowledgeable
people to ask it. The first answer I got was "RTFM". So, I read the wget man
page, but could not find it there. Eventually, after telling people that it
would be faster to give an answer, I got a reply ( add the -np -r flags). But
this has been the last straw.

I composed my own acronym. Just like RTFM is "Read the Fabulous Manual" and
STFW is "Search the Fabulous Web", then JATFM is "Just Answer the Fabulous
Man". It means that it’s usually faster to answer someone’s question than to
ask him to RTFM, which is just going to annoy him. I think the RTFM mantra has
done a lot of damage in the UNIX/Linux world, and I hope JATFMing would prove
to be a more healthy ideology.

I don’t suppose we should propose that as an alternative to Perl Gods, there
should at least be Perl Saints:

http://www.stallman.org/saint.html

Of course, I’m not sure what being a Perl saint would imply. Using nothing but
Perl? (Including not C in which perl 5 is written?)

 <trashguy>  atleast the variabls are obvious and not mistaken for

 <elgrande>  i stringly recommend to call variables only: var1, var2, var3

 <elgrande>  rindolf: and of course: cls1, func1, meth1, if1

it kept getting stuck and we lost all our data. We had to reboot it.

B: You used Windows 95! Lucky Bastard! When I was your age, we used DOS on CGA

environment.

C: You had DOS with graphics? Lucky bastard! When I was your age, I used
VT-100 terminals connected to a VAX. 128 characters should be enough for
everybody?

D: Visual Terminals? When I was your age, we used teletypes on a PDP-11: the
computer printed on paper - very slowly. Can you imagine cat’ing a really long
document?

E: Teletypes were heaven compared to the punch cards that I was using. Imagine
going over to the computer with a large amount of punch cards and then
dropping them all.

F: Punch cards! What is this talk about punch cards? We input machine code
directly using buttons and LEDs.

     <rindolf>  scorchsaber+=1
       <rillo>  ??
     <rindolf>  rillo: Python does not have a ++ operator.
 <scorchsaber>  rindolf: Oh, but it does have a + operator.
       <rillo>  ah. i'm new to python so i diddnt know
 <scorchsaber>  A few days ago, it was suggested that I implement ++ using
                the + operator.
 <scorchsaber>  And I did so. :)
 <scorchsaber>  So, really, a++; is valid in Python, and it may even
                increment a by one. If somebody was crazy, anyhow, and if
                a was mutable.
       <rillo>  shall i move back to perl to get the ++
       <rillo>  ?

  <TimToady>  no, English was my first language. :)
   <rindolf>  TimToady: I started with XT ROM BASIC, but I suppose it was
              something like Perl 5 was to Perl 4 for your BASIC.
   <rindolf>  BASIC has greatly evolved since Dartmouth BASIC.
   <rindolf>  TimToady: ah.

     <Juerd>  21:04 <@TimToady> we have a test suite right now because of

     <Juerd>  Very, very important.
   <rindolf>  diakopter: I don't know.
   <rindolf>  Juerd: yes, very.
   <rindolf>  Juerd: anyway, I expect that at every given time all tests
              will pass.
     <Juerd>  Well, there are probably bad tests too :)
     <Juerd>  Given the volume of the suite, and that pugs has never been

   <rindolf>  How long does it take Pugs to run the entire Pugs test

  <TimToady>  first make it run, then make it run right, then make it run

   <rindolf>  TimToady: another problem with Pugs is that it kept

  <pmurias>  rindolf: what is Park/Spark?
  <rindolf>  pmurias:
             http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/Park-Lisp/
  <rindolf>  pmurias: it's still incomplete.
  <rindolf>  And I haven't updated it.
  <pmurias>  rindolf: if you like lisp/perl6 projects you might consider
             helping with a common lisp elf backend
  <rindolf>  pmurias: Common Lisp.
  <rindolf>  pmurias: thing is I think both CL and Scheme suck.
  <rindolf>  I like Lisp as a concept.
  <rindolf>  Arc is nice, but has too many implementation problems.
  <rindolf>  And missing features.
    <vixey>  Arc is not nice
  <rindolf>  I want to give a presentation to the Perl Mongers about
             "Foreign Languages: Lisp"
  <rindolf>  vixey: I like it.
  <rindolf>  Though I hate that "(not)" has become "(no)"
  <rindolf>  it's so non-English.
    <vixey>  it's just TCL with horrible syntax
  <rindolf>  vixey: but it's missing a lot of exciting features.
  <rindolf>  Which PG deemed as unnecessary.
  <rindolf>  Doesn't look like the 100-years language to me.
  <rindolf>  Which is why - Spark!
  <pmurias>  why not just write an s-expression p6 dialect?
  <rindolf>  pmurias: could be.
  <rindolf>  pmurias: it's another approach.
  <rindolf>  But some things make sense in Lisp and not in p6.
  <rindolf>  For example, Perl does not like to use + for string or list
             concat.
  <rindolf>  While Python does and it seems to be OK in Arc too.
  <rindolf>  And in CL you have (concatenate) (yuck!).
  <pbuetow>  (((hehe)))
  <pmurias>  + for strings sucks
    <Auzon>  seconded.
    <vixey>  rindolf: If you don't like CONCATENATE you can just rename it
  <rindolf>  vixey: yeah.
  <rindolf>  vixey: but I'd rather not rename concatenate because then
             people won't understand my code.
  <rindolf>  vixey: as TimToady said people hate abstractions.
    <vixey>  yes they will rindolf
  <rindolf>  They want things to work out of the box.
    <vixey>  A program is many many totally newly defined procedures
    <vixey>  just renaming one thing is nothing in the context of a big
             program
  <rindolf>  vixey: "let's spend 3 days creating a new language, and 1 day
             implementing the solution with it."
 <TimToady>  if it would take 10 days without the new language, it's worth
             it
  <rindolf>  TimToady: yeah.
  <rindolf>  TimToady: but this is the CL mentality.
    <vixey>  no it's not
  <rindolf>  Sometimes you can take 1 day to write an API.
    <vixey>  CL is too diverse you cannot generalize like that
  <rindolf>  vixey: I meant a common idiom there.
  <rindolf>  I think I'll /quit and do something productive.
  <rindolf>  Like work on Spark.
    <vixey>  another quote:
    <vixey>  how to write any computer program in two easy stages:
    <vixey>  Design and implement the programming language which would be
             best for solving the problem.
    <vixey>  Write the program in the language you’ve just implemented.
  <rindolf>  vixey: or just use Perl which is the best for everything.
    <vixey>  heh
 <TimToady>  the second step is obvious--the best language for the job is
             one that does the job on a null input
          *  pmichaud notes that vixey's algorithm is somewhat recursive
 <TimToady>  "All rules of thumb are false, including this one."
  <pmurias>  rindolf: when you feel like writing Common Lisp backends,
             contact me or mncharity ;)

you know.

Which may lead to interesting philosophical issues. BTW, in a conference I was

They still have some issue with the retrieval procedures, but besides of that
- they are quite a trusted service.

Richard M. Stallman (RMS) decides to release his brand-new editor, "Emacs" on
the CPAN with its first version 29.999.99. In order to package it, he invokes
the trusty ol’ module-starter (see
http://search.cpan.org/dist/Module-Starter/) which creates a skeleton of a
CPAN distribution for him.

He fills in the skeleton with the actual code of Emacs, types "perl Build.PL",
and "./Build test" and makes sure all the tests pass. Then he types "./Build
config --gui" and gets a nice GUI to configure the various parameters of the
Module meta-data.[M-B-Data]

In the GUI, Richard goes to the Trove categorisation tab, and selects
categories. This is done in a similar way to Freshmeat’s project
categorisation dialog (a list of options to the left, with selected options to
the right and arrows to move them left or right, while allowing multiple
select options.). He chooses such categories as "Programming Language ::
Lisp", and "Intended Audience :: Emacs Users", "Operating System :: GNU", and
"Topic :: Editors". (Note: I believe the category list should be fetched using
a public web-service to keep them up-to-date.)

After several weeks of having the editor on CPAN, Richard has received many
patches, and wrote a lot of code on his own. Now Emacs is not only an editor
but a calendar tool, an Eliza program, a web browser, a mail user agent and
many other things.

So in order to release version 30.000.00 he needs to update the
categorisation. He runs ./Build config --gui again, and adds more categories.
However, he enters too many categories (because Emacs now does them all), and
the GUI refuses to save the file because it will overflow the limit that the
web-service specified the CPAN classification services allow to handle. So
Richard keeps only the important categories, adds more tags, and saves it.

He then tests the distribution again, and uploads the new distribution to the
CPAN.

Bill Gates, CEO of Microsoft decides to use Richard Stallman’s Emacs as the
basis of his company’s state-of-the-art product Microsoft Editing Macros™
Enterprise Edition XP .NET Professional. However since MS Editing Macros™ is a
commercial, proprietary program which he intends to sell at computer stores,
Bill is not going to upload it to the CPAN. He builds upon Emacs, sends
patches to Richard and learns a lot about it.

When he’s finished building Microsoft Editing Macros™ he surfs to the Emacs
homepage on CPAN, and adds some categories and tags of his own.

Eventually, enough people like Bill tag and categorise Emacs, and it gains
more classification.

PHP error debug list:

1) did you use the correct argument order? if you’re a good programmer, use
the *reverse* from what you think it is. see if it works. no? you’re not a
good programmer, or you learned php’s braindeadness and can go on to step 2).

2) did you think about your code? if so, don’t. php will do it for you so you
can do mindbogglingly stupid stuff, such as not escape the data that goes into
your sql queries.

  <Su-Shee>  rindolf: yes, I played with Squeak a little and yes I'd like
             a vim clone written in perl.
  <Makoryu>  Why isn't there one already, then?
  <Makoryu>  (A vim clone in Perl)
  <Su-Shee>  good question. there's one in javascript :)
  <rindolf>  Su-Shee: actually , it's a vi clone.
  <rindolf>  Writing a vi clone is much easier than writing a vim clone.
  <rindolf>  Just like writing a Scheme clone is much easier than writing
             a Perl 6 implementation.
  <rindolf>  Unless you're Chuck Norris.
  <Su-Shee>  rindolf: darn.. he already wrote a vim in perl6?
  <moritz_>  no, he scared K&R into writing it ;-)
  <rindolf>  Su-Shee: Chuck Norris is the ghost author of the entire
             Debian GNU/Linux distribution.
  <rindolf>  Su-Shee: and he wrote it in 24 hours, while taking snack
             breaks.
  <Su-Shee>  rindolf: yes, I know - he published slackware under the
             pseudonym patrick volkerding...
  <rindolf>  Chuck Norris read the entire Wikipedia. Twice.
   <araujo>  the second time includes fixing all its errors
  <moritz_>  but he didn't commmit his changes, it seems
  <rindolf>  moritz_: heh.
  <rindolf>  LOL.
   <araujo>  Chuck Norris doesn't commit changes, the changes commit for
             him
   <araujo>  :)
  <rindolf>  Code is too scared of Chuck to be wrong.
  <rindolf>  It is generated right in the first time.
  <rindolf>  Bugs are too afraid to reproduce on Chuck Norris' computer.
  <Su-Shee>  .o(I see a chuck norris release on the horizon... ;)
  <rindolf>  Su-Shee: :-)
  <Su-Shee>  we could ask chuck norris if he's willing to promote the star
             release.. ;)) (which probably kill the entire internet due to
             laughter.. :)
   <araujo>  Perl 6 - A Chuck Norris like language
 <dukeleto>  Chuck Norris has actually been using Perl 6 since 1987, and

  <Su-Shee>  rakudo - chuck's choice ;)
  <Su-Shee>  well, camelia and chuck norris go well together. ;)
  <rindolf>  OK.
  <rindolf>  Of course everybody know Chuck Norris is a real programmer.
  <rindolf>  He designs machines by combining individual atoms.
  <rindolf>  Using his thought.
  <rindolf>  Atoms obey Chuck Norris.

 <shlomif>  Larry Wall seems a bit less funny on IRC than on Usenet or

 <shlomif>  But he's not always funny.
 <shlomif>  IRL, he's really funny.
 <shlomif>  He gives funny presentations.
   <sjors>  I don't have the place in ottd to *force* them to do the right
            thing, but they do stuff like making 90 degree corners,
            stopping three other trains in their tracks, just because it's

 <whoppix>  Quick git question, perhaps someone knows the answer: I have a
            file in my git tree (locally and in the repository), but I
            want git to ignore the file completely, i.e. git is not to
            touch the file on the filesystem by updating it or merging
            local changes into the repostiroy
 <rindolf>  whoppix: you can use .gitignore
 <rindolf>  I think
 <whoppix>  rindolf, hmm, good idea, thanks.
 <whoppix>  that was slow.
 <whoppix>  rindolf, hm, I think git update-index --assume-unchanged is
            what I need.
 <whoppix>  .gitignore is only for untracked files
 <rindolf>  whoppix: OK, have no clue what that is.
 <rindolf>  Git is so complicated.
 <rindolf>  And so opaque
 <whoppix>  rindolf, me neither, but the doc tells me to use that.
 <rindolf>  whoppix: can you believe the docs?
 <rindolf>  The docs may be lying.
 <rindolf>  Don't trust the docs.
 <rindolf>  Don't trust anything.

            above modules are adopted.

Mike “The Mouse” House (a.k.a “D.J. Salinger”) was a minor rap artist, and a
computer geek when he decided to start selling CDs of open-source software. He
turned to spamming to publicise his business, but found out that the spam he
sent was trapped by most spam traps. He decided to use the notorious obscured
image spam, but since he had a few blind friends, decided to also include an
audio recording of a rap song with the spam message.

House received a few offers from his spam campaign, but his real break came
when a few enthusiasts of the spam song shared it on the Internet, where it
became an instant hit. The song eventually hit the charts and MTV, and made
D.J. Salinger famous, who quickly released his first successful album called
/Rap to the spam, Ma’am!/, with such highly acclaimed hits as “Rap to not get
trapped” and “He ain’t Nigerian. He’s a Spammer!”.

As a millionaire, House decided to donate some of his money back to sponsoring
open-source projects, and has donated 100,000’s of U.S. Dollars to such causes
as [the Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/), [Linux
International](http://www.li.org/) and
[SpamAssassin](http://spamassassin.apache.org/). “If it hadn’t been for them,
I wouldn’t have made it big”, he said, and said he’s now working on a second
album with a similar theme.

All languages of the world suck. If you require people to declare variables
(like in Pascal, C,
[Scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29) or
Perl 5 with [strict](http://perldoc.perl.org/strict.html)), then people will
tell you they like variables to spring up upon first use. Without variable
declarations, then you get various weird side-effects of the implicit scoping.
If you use curly braces for scoping, then you’ll have to type more and there’s
more clutter. With indentation-based scoping (like in Python), you’ll find it
hard to introduce multiple-expression
[lambdas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#First-class_functions).

Rob Pike and Paul Graham hated object oriented programming (OOP) and so they
didn’t introduce it in their
[“Go”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28programming_language%29) and
[“Arc“](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_%28programming_language%29)
languages, well after OOP has become mainstream. And guess what? Many people,
including me, think that OOP is still a good thing (and no, in my opinion, C++
did not do OOP very well) and so gave up on Arc quickly and did not look
closely at Go.

Dynamically typed languages (like Perl 5, Python, Ruby, or Lisp) possibly
suffer from many subtle errors ; Statically typed languages (like Haskell) are
less expressive and it seems that about one third of the language design
papers published on [Lambda the Ultimate](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/) are
about various funky extensions to the Haskell type system to allow for better
expressiveness.

Purely functional languages have no assignment and most people find them
harder, in part because the world around us has a lot of state, and they also
need to do funky compiler tricks to make you feel like you don’t need
assignment. Non-functional languages have side-effects and so are prone to
many errors.

If you have goto or goto-like statements (such as exceptions or Perl 5’s “last
LABEL;” (more like “break” in C) or “next LABEL;”), then you encourage code to
not be factored correctly. If you don’t have such stuff, then programmers will
hate you for having to go through many hoops to write quick-and-dirty code.

Perl 5 has a dedicated regular expression syntax which is treated magically by
the parser. PHP and Java use strings for them, and require weird escaping and
backslashing rules to interpolate the sub-regexes inside them. And if you
incorporate a first-order syntax for regular expressions, then people will
want similar first-order syntaxes for XPath, for XML (like some recent
versions of Visual Basic .NET have), and for all other grammars you may need
to embed.

Finally, many people absolutely hate all the clutter created by the leading
[sigils](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil_%28computer_programming%29) of
Perl 5 (the "$", "@", etc.), and similar languages, but they allow for much
better backward compatibility, facilitate the so-called “interpolation” (=
embedding inside strings), and also give some important visual cues when
skimming code (even without syntax highlighting).

about Roles. And Moose! And Roles in Moose! And Moose in Roles! And Roles

          <rindolf>  Hi all.
         <Leuthihi>  O HAI rindolf
          <rindolf>  Leuthihi: HAI HAI.
          <rindolf>  Leuthihi: what's up?
         <Leuthihi>  rindolf: I'm hungry!
          <rindolf>  Leuthihi: there's one antidote for it.
          <rindolf>  Leuthihi: it's called Food.
          <rindolf>  Leuthihi: </bolt>
         <Leuthihi>  well, but what food?
         <Leuthihi>  and I need coffee
         <Leuthihi>  oh, I think I know what I'll have.
 <benwbrum_chez_so>  Chili. A big bowl of red, with crackers and onions on
                     the side.
          <rindolf>  Leuthihi: does it matter?
            <Volis>  If it has to be some cuisine.
            <Volis>  Did I spell correctly?
          <rindolf>  Volis: spell what?
            <Volis>  oh yes.
            <Volis>  cuisine.
          <rindolf>  "cuisine" is spelt this way.
          <rindolf>  Yes.
          <rindolf>  It's a French word I think.
          <rindolf>  .ety cuisine
           <la_fen>  "1786, from Fr. cuisine 'style of cooking,'
                     originally 'kitchen, cooking, cooked food' (12c.),
                     from L.L. cocina, earlier coquina 'kitchen,' from L.
                     coquere 'to cook' (see cook (n.))." -
                     http://etymonline.com/?term=cuisine
          <rindolf>  OK, originally from Latin.
            <Volis>  nevermind. Which cuisine is the best?
            <Volis>  In general
          <rindolf>  Volis: I like many cuisines.
           <Gvidon>  Russian, of course
          <rindolf>  Volis: though most of the ethnic food is actually
                     poor men's food.
          <rindolf>  Gvidon: Russian cuisine?
           <Gvidon>  rindolf: Yes
         <Leuthihi>  well, yes, because I need something to eat to be able
                     to eat it.
          <rindolf>  Gvidon: what does it feature?
            <Volis>  Russian cuisine lacks flavour.
           <Gvidon>  rindolf: Vodka
          <rindolf>  Gvidon: ah.
         <Leuthihi>  In Soviet Russia, food tastes YOU!
          <rindolf>  Gvidon: I didn't know Vodka is nutritious
          <rindolf>  Leuthihi: :-)
            <Volis>  In Soviet Russia, They no longer use this meme. :P
         <Leuthihi>  Vodka has plenty of calories at least.
          <rindolf>  Gvidon: and I don't consume Alcoholic beverages in
                     any quantity.
          <rindolf>  Volis: :-)
         <Leuthihi>  Volis: because: In Soviet Russia, meme uses You!
          <rindolf>  «In Soviet Russia, cats own you. Oh wait! They own
                     you everywhere.»
            <Volis>  Considering the fact, i'm still underage. Please
                     change the topic.
          <rindolf>  Volis: underage?
          <rindolf>  Volis: ah, you cannot drink?
            <Volis>  In Soviet Russia, left keeps you. Always.
            <Volis>  "Dear fellow driver, let left be for communist crap
                     only"
            <Volis>  rindolf, Rules of the world.

 <linuxguy101>  sebsebseb: i thought you were abducted by windows 8
     <rindolf>  sebsebseb: hi.
 <linuxguy101>  rindolf: windows got him
     <rindolf>  linuxguy101: if you say so.
 <linuxguy101>  he is trying to find that icon in windows 8 that has irc
                on it
 <linuxguy101>  average users it usually will take a day or longer
 <linuxguy101>  it is a productivity enhancer
     <rindolf>  linuxguy101: heh.
 <linuxguy101>  rindolf: you must get windows 8
 <linuxguy101>  it is an experience in windows you will never forget
     <rindolf>  linuxguy101: why?
 <linuxguy101>  rindolf: it is like windows me and vista combined with a
                bunch of retarded programmers who cant speak the same lang
 <linuxguy101>  it is jaw dropping
     <rindolf>  linuxguy101: sounds fascinating.
 <linuxguy101>  i expect Microsoft will earn some rewards on this os
 <linuxguy101>  like longest boot time.. Hardest os to use by a human. And
                most compatible os with itself ever made.
     <rindolf>  linuxguy101: :-)
 <linuxguy101>  rindolf: you must switch to something less useful and more
                productive like windows 8
 <linuxguy101>  think of the hours you could spend on windows 8.. remember
                it is retro
     <rindolf>  linuxguy101: retrofitted?
 <linuxguy101>  rindolf: yes.. down to 2 or 4 colors.. steve balmer in a
                cocaine brain storming meeting with the developers decided
                to move to a gui that was un pattoned so they invented
                retro.. simple and stupid colors a 4 year old child could
                barely read or draw
 <linuxguy101>  he called it retro
     <rindolf>  Retro.
 <linuxguy101>  clearly a first in computing history
     <rindolf>  Now I get the joke.
     <rindolf>  Metro is Retro.
 <linuxguy101>  oh it is no joke.. just wait for windows 8 lack of sales
                prompt stever balmer to shove it down into the updates for
                windows 7
 <linuxguy101>  on a side note, did you know that linux is becoming more
                popular now days?
 <linuxguy101>  i dont know why..
 <linuxguy101>  rindolf: you really should try windows 8
 <linuxguy101>  at least virtual box it..
     <rindolf>  linuxguy101: maybe I should, but I'm not going to shell
                out money for the experience.
 <linuxguy101>  Warning!: using windows 8 may cause massive hysteria,
                laughing and vomiting in some cases..
 <linuxguy101>  the first time i used windows 8 i laughed uncontrolably
                for several hours and almost wet myself

 <rindolf>  Hi all.
 <srogers>  howdy
 <rindolf>  srogers: hi, what's up?
 <srogers>  work, mostly
 <srogers>  "one of those days"
 <rindolf>  Ah.
 <rindolf>  Work.
 <rindolf>  I'm enjoying my unemployed status.
 <rindolf>  And after all that hospital thing is behind me, I'd like to go
            to tau.ac.il and set up some events where I read from my
            writings/etc.
 <rindolf>  To gain some esteem.
 <rindolf>  I contacted an Israeli publisher about publishing some of my
            stories and/or essays, but they didn't return to me after more
            than a month (which is their designated limit).
 <rindolf>  And after reminding them on the phone, I gave up.
 <rindolf>  Well, I'm not going to sit idly and expect recognition to come
            to me.
 <rindolf>  Maybe I'll use some of my Project Wonderful money to gain some
            publicity.
 <rindolf>  I could try publicising some of my works on various sites such
            as http://www.calamitiesofnature.com/
 <srogers>  Yeah - promote yourself
 <rindolf>  srogers: yes.
 <rindolf>  srogers: I think that was the main mistake of Howard Roark in
            The Fountainhead.
 <rindolf>  He should have worked more on publicity.
 <srogers>  ha - if only he had Facebook . . .
 <rindolf>  Heh.

     <mrout>  Who likes freedom?
     <mrout>  FREEDOM
   <rindolf>  mrout: freedom++
    <Younos>  just give me my beer
   <rindolf>  Younos: heh.
   <rindolf>  No beer for you!
    <Younos>  aww :o(
     <mrout>  I’m in non-freedom mode atm actually, using Windoze
     <mrout>  for teh gamez
   <rindolf>  mrout: OK.
     <mrout>  but when I restart into Linux I respect the freedoms of
              myself and others
   <rindolf>  mrout: OK.
    <Younos>  you should respect it regardless of the platform
   <rindolf>  mrout: maybe try reporting it as a bug in WINE/etc.
   <rindolf>  mrout: the GNU project encourages FOSS developers to port
              their software to non-free platforms.
   <rindolf>  Though there was a small backlash about it (at least for
              Windows) a while ago.
 <alfplayer>  encourages?
     <mrout>  rindolf: I sure hope it does. if we can encourage users to
              try FOSS software on non-free platforms, they might more
              easily learn about FOSS and about how to protect their
              freedoms
   <rindolf>  http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/download.html - I provide a
              Windows binary for this. :-)
     <mrout>  Many users don’t even know they can get software that
              respects their freedoms.
   <rindolf>  alfplayer: well, don't know if encourage, but it doesn't
              hold a stand against it.
   <rindolf>  alfplayer: and a lot of GNU software can be built fine on
              Windows (And proprietary UNIXes).
 <alfplayer>  rindolf: that's very different imo
 <alfplayer>  rindolf: yes, like gcc and emacs
     <mrout>  btw is rms ever on here? He gave a talk at my local
              university a few years ago, and I never got a chance to talk

              - also see this.
     <mrout>  lol
   <rindolf>  mrout: I don't think he uses IRC.
   <rindolf>  mrout: he also doesn't use a graphical web browser.
   <rindolf>  mrout: though he does read the web sometimes.
     <mrout>  rindolf: i haven’t installed X yet, so neither do I. haha
   <rindolf>  He commented on a few pages on my site.
   <rindolf>  When he visited Israel, I told RMS that I felt making
              Freecell Solver Public Domain (now it's MIT/X11L) was
              appropriate given its target audience, and he said he
              thought making it GPLed would encourage more users of
              programs that used it to make them FOSS.
   <rindolf>  He also said it was OK that freshmeat.net (now freecode.com)
              did not release their backend as free software.
   <rindolf>  mrout: ah.
     <mrout>  freecode.com?
   <rindolf>  mrout: well, I think he doesn't even use links or lynx or
              Emacs' www-mode.
   <rindolf>  mrout: yes.
   <rindolf>  mrout: they changed their name and domain.
     <mrout>  who are they? NEVER heard of them
   <rindolf>  mrout: http://freecode.com/ - it's a nice way to discover
              some interesting software.
   <rindolf>  mrout: they are a web-directory for UNIX software.
     <mrout>  do they host it?
   <rindolf>  mrout: no.
     <mrout>  quite unlike something like github, then?
   <rindolf>  mrout: just link to it.
     <mrout>  cool
     <mrout>  will try to remember that
   <rindolf>  mrout: also see
              http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Freecell-Solver/slides/freshmeat_effect.html
   <rindolf>  mrout: not everything there is FOSS.
      <mtjm>  http://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html explains his Web
              use
   <rindolf>  mrout: and not everything is there.
   <rindolf>  mrout: but I try to publicise most of my major software
              there.
      <mtjm>  IRC would need a constant network access which is difficult
              when travelling (and needs much mor e time than batch mail
              writing)
   <rindolf>  Well, most of the software published there is either niche
              or quite boring.
     <mrout>  rindolf: Freecell Solver on freecode is the first result
   <rindolf>  mrout: for what?
     <mrout>  that google search
     <mrout>  I fail to see a problem
   <rindolf>  mrout: well, thing is there are other Freecell solvers.
   <rindolf>  mrout: and what I said is that I clog the search.
     <mrout>  Oh, I see what you mean
     <mrout>  that’s a good thing for you, though
   <rindolf>  mrout: lots of junk like
              FreeBSD/Debian/Ubuntu/Mandriva/Mageia packages.
   <rindolf>  mrout: that's what I call the freshmeat effect.
   <rindolf>  I get http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/ as the first hit. :-(

     <mrout>  New Zealand.
   <rindolf>  mrout: but shlomifish.org is hosted in hostgator.com .
   <rindolf>  I used to host it in a small Israeli hosting provider but
              they were too unreliable.
     <mrout>  I asked, because i expected it to be US, and so I’d say “I
              know what US stands for, but you don’t know what NZ stands
              for? Shame on you.”
   <rindolf>  mrout: I know that .nz is New Zealand.
   <rindolf>  mrout: but didn't understand the initialism in the context.
   <rindolf>  mrout: some Americans think .il is Illinois.
   <rindolf>  And .ca is California.
   <rindolf>  Well, there's also .la.

     <mrout>  yeah
     <mrout>  Woo tokelau
           *  rindolf wonders if there is .fs.
   <rindolf>  There should be a country called .if so I can register

   <rindolf>  Someone registered shlomifi.sh. ;-)
   <rindolf>  Not me, though.
   <rindolf>  https://www.google.com/search?q=.lf - no .lf either.
   <rindolf>  We need more countries.
     <mrout>  I wish there was a .ut
     <mrout>  so I could get mro.ut
   <rindolf>  mrout: ah.
   <rindolf>  Well, I can register shlomif.name.
     <mrout>  I already have rout.co.nz (that’s my dad’s actually) and
              rout.geek.nz (mine)
   <rindolf>  mrout: ah.
   <rindolf>  Are top-level .nz domains available?
   <rindolf>  like rout.nz
     <mrout>  you can’t get milesroutisawesome.nz, no
   <rindolf>  Ah.
     <mrout>  or rout.nz >.>
   <rindolf>  OK.
   <rindolf>  .il domains are kinda costly and they used to require
              faxing.
   <rindolf>  And I don't feel my domains are particularly
              Israeli-related.
     <mrout>  ahh
   <rindolf>  Well, I originally got shlomif.il.eu.org.
   <rindolf>  But its DNS was flaky.
     <mrout>  .eu.org?
   <rindolf>  So I ended up buying shlomifish.org
     <mrout>  what’s your actual name?
   <rindolf>  Now I also have shlomifish.com
   <rindolf>  mrout: Shlomi Fish.
     <mrout>  Ahh
   <rindolf>  mrout: eu.org is free DNS.
     <mrout>  ?
   <rindolf>  But I guess you get what you pay for sometimes.
   <rindolf>  mrout: it's not .eu (European union).
   <rindolf>  mrout: http://eu.org/
     <mrout>  that site’s odd
     <mrout>  what’s wrong with .eu
     <mrout>  shit a brick, they want a separate ccTLD for
              http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Martin_(France)
   <rindolf>  mrout: nothing is wrong with .eu - it's just that eu.org is
              something different.
   <rindolf>  eu.org predates .eu.
     <mrout>  ahh
     <mrout>  it annoys me that the US doesn’t use .us more
     <mrout>  and clutters .com
   <rindolf>  Well, there's also .gov, .net, .org...
   <rindolf>  .mil
   <rindolf>  .navy
     <mrout>  exactly
   <rindolf>  mrout: I also have http://shlom.in/
     <mrout>  it’s pretty americo-centric
   <rindolf>  Could not get http://shlom.fi/ because my domain registrar
              did not have it.
   <rindolf>  shlom.in is my own custom (and private) URL shortener.
   <rindolf>  Some overzealous spam filters blocked it.
   <rindolf>  Ah, domains.
   <rindolf>  The bread and butter of Internet conversations.
     <mrout>  lol
   <rindolf>  I know someone who has http://ali.as/
   <rindolf>  Well, from the Internet.
   <rindolf>  And there's also cr.yp.to which is Dan Bernstein.
   <rindolf>  DJB.
     <mrout>  domains, vim vs emacs and hello_there vs helloThere.
     <mrout>  cr.yp.to is cool
   <rindolf>  mrout: and tabs vs. spaces.
     <mrout>  but hard to type
     <mrout>  eugh
     <mrout>  cr.yp.to is hard to type
     <mrout>  spaces, vim, hello_there or HelloThere, but never
              helloThere.
   <rindolf>  Since I have http://perl-begin.org/ and want to create a
              site for Vim beginners, I should get a good domain.
   <rindolf>  vim.perl-begin.org or vim.shlomifish.org does not look good.

     <mrout>  begin.tel?
     <mrout>  begintel?
     <mrout>  $17/yr for mil.es
     <mrout>  YES FUCK YES
   <rindolf>  OK, I registered begin-site.org and begin-site.com

     <mrout>  what about rindolf.com
     <mrout>  begin-site seems a bit clunky
   <rindolf>  mrout: rindolf is only my IRC nickname.
     <mrout>  still
   <rindolf>  mrout: and I already have www.shlomifish.org
   <rindolf>  mrout: I don't see why most people will STFW for "rindolf"
              or "shlomi fish" or whatever.
   <rindolf>  Most of the people come to my site using more generic
              searches.

     <mrout>  they deleted your user page?
   <rindolf>  mrout: no, only /wiki/Freecell_Solver

   <rindolf>  mrout: access the link - it's there.
   <rindolf>  Just not visible on default searches.
     <mrout>  “lacks references showing notability” you mean apart from

              FUUUUU wikipedians
   <rindolf>  I restored it before it was deleted.

              - some people on #wikipedia (or #wikipedia-en) told me this
              may not be notable.
   <rindolf>  There are a zillion pages about it.
   <rindolf>  And Wikipedia covers almost any other Solitaire variant.
     <mrout>  lol, fucking wikipedia
   <rindolf>  Yes.
     <mrout>  articles about every steeple in Italy, but not about ever

   <rindolf>  mrout: also about football players.
     <mrout>  your article should be restored
   <rindolf>  mrout: yes, maybe.

   <rindolf>  mrout: are you a wikipedian?
     <mrout>  sort of
     <mrout>  I have an account
   <rindolf>  mrout: well, I added the [[Freecell Solver]] link.
   <rindolf>  Hoping someone will fill it in.
   <rindolf>  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCell#Solvers - there is a
              cursory mention of it there.
     <mrout>  mmm
   <rindolf>  mrout: this section was deleted previously because it was
              not "Encyclopedic enough."
   <rindolf>  mrout: that Wikipedian had tons of complaints against him on
              his user talk page.
   <rindolf>  mrout: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Christiansen - this
              used to be about the Perl developer (and co-author of
              several books).
   <rindolf>  Now it's about an olympic athelete.
   <rindolf>  Well, I added that page, and people enhanced it, but then it
              was deleted. :-(
     <mrout>  not even an olympic athelete
   <rindolf>  mrout: ah, yes, just world competition.
     <mrout>  didn’t even place

I recall discussing Buffy with a Jewish American friend, who used to be
secular, and now has become an observant Jew, and married a woman who properly
converted to Orthodox Judaism, and they have some children. We discussed the
fact that Sarah Michelle Gellar was Jewish, and yet that many men (and some
Lesbian women) were more attracted to Alyson Hannigan’s character, Willow
Rosenberg, who was a shy and sheepish, redhead, Jewess. Then when I mentioned
that Hannigan was only a maternal Jew, he said she is “kosher” (because
someone whose mother is Jewish and who did not convert to a different
religion, is a bona-fide Jew). I found it amusing that you refer to women by
the same word as you do to food, but I think the ancient Hebrew word "kasher"
also means "approved", "appropriate", "legal", etc.

In any case, both Hannigan and Gellar are now married, and so trying to
separate between them and their husbands is not kosher. ;-)

[There are three young men dressed as Klingons who fight with Bat’leth in the
park. Selina is passing by and shakes her head in disapproval. The three
notice Selina, and quickly run to her.]

Warrior #1: Hail The Slayer, we are but your humble slaves!

Selina: [Shocked] And who might you be?

Warrior #1: We are The Three - three vampire brother warriors, who have been
fighting since the dawn of time.

Selina: And you are Klingons…

Warrior #2: We can assume any form.

Warrior #1: Yes, we can fight using any weapon, and we are masters of them
all.

Selina: so you can fight with something that’s not a Bat’leth?

Warrior #1: Of course, for example, we could fight using the Huge Sword!

Warrior #2 and Warrior #3: Yeah, the Huge Sword!

The Three: [in unison] Huge Sword!

[Warrior #1 snaps his fingers, and some of these ridiculously large swords
from World of Warcraft appear on the ground.]

Selina: Wow, can you fight using them?

The Three: [non-dramatically] Eh, eh, we cannot lift them.

Selina: Guess not. [Puts her palm on her eyes.] Maybe try something smaller
and not as heavy.

Warrior #2: Yes, smaller.

Warrior #3: And not as heavy.

Warrior #1: You're not thinking about the smallest… yet deadliest weapon for a
mighty vampire warrior… the wooden toothpick!

[The three cry “yeah”. Warrior #1 snaps his fingers and the huge swords are
replaced by small wooden toothpicks.]

Selina: Toothpicks? Have you blokes been watching too much Sesame Street?

Warrior #1: Why, of course! Every mighty Klingon warrior has watched Sesame
Street.

Selina: Mighty Klingon vampire warriors who have watched Sesame Street… this
decade royally sucks!!

The Israelites and the Philistines schedule a large battle. The Philistines
have far superior equipment with armours made out of iron, which the
Israelites don’t have. Eventually, Goliath, a tall Philistine giant, steps
forward and asks for an Israelite man worthy enough to fight him and determine
the fate of the battle (something which was quite common in the ancient Near
East). It seems the Israelites will lose the battle.

Out of nowhere, a young Israelite boy whom hardly anyone knew about steps
forward with a sling and a few pebbles. Goliath thinks this is ridiculous and
ridicules him. However, the boy quickly puts a pebble in his sling, and after
rotating the sling to achieve a very large velocity (not unusual with slings)
hurls the pebble with great accuracy (also not unthinkable, because shepherds
in the Near East effectively used slings to kill lions and other predators to
their flock) into Goliath’s face, which was uncovered to allow him to see.
Even if Goliath’s shield bearer wanted to, he could not lift the huge shield
in time, and Goliath was completely not agile in his suit and armour. The
sling’s rock smashes Goliath’s brain, and he falls to the ground dead. The
Israelites have won the battle.

That boy’s name was David.

Why is it important here? Because David was a “hacker”. Why was he a hacker?
Because he knew the rules, and played by them, but knew how to bend them, in
order to earn his victory. Hackers bend the rules.

And here’s the thing: this is what an action hero is all about: he makes his
own rules, or he even breaks them, and does not accept his fate. This is
whereas a tragic hero is bound by many invisible rules, and accepts his fate,
which is, almost certainly going to be death.

And in real life, you should also aim to be a hacker or an action hero, or the
many phrases it used to be called.

Worf: Commander Dax, I explicitly prohibit you from asking about Mr. Q’s roles
as a husband and a father.

Jadzia: You are right, Commander. I’ve realised something: throughout this
whole trip through the wonders of the Q continuum I’ve been far too selfish
and only thought about myself. I should have thought about you, too.

[She turns towards Avigayil]

Jadzia: Avigayil, could you, by any chance, allow us to meet Kahless the
Unforgettable in his living dead self, I’m sure Commander Worf here would love
to meet him.

Worf: Actually, Commander, I don’t think…

Jadzia: [Interrupting him] Oh, you don’t? That’s a shame. Well, I’ll go meet
him alone (always wanted to, you know). Worf, I think Kahless will be
disappointed not to meet you, but I’ll tell him you’re a big fan of his, and
I’ll let you watch the video of me meeting him and…

Worf: [Sighs] Commander Dax, you are impossible.

Fine, let’s go meet Kahless if that’s humanly possible.

Avigayil: Sounds good. The whole mission from Deep Space Nine can go with you,
I’ll notify Kahless. He’s a big fan of a lot of you.

Amanda: OK, let’s summon Katie and her gang of no-goodnicks too. She wouldn’t
want to miss it.

Quark: Yes, and it’s high time we merged the two sub-plots in the future
movie. “Too much of a good thing is a bad thing. But only for your customers”.

   <ZetaNeta>  i wonder, if one day, developers will lose the possibility
               to write code no one else can understand.
   <ZetaNeta>  If CPUs will start running interpretable code
    <rindolf>  ZetaNeta: you can always obfuscate code.
    <rindolf>  ZetaNeta: nothing guarantees that a code will be readable.
   <ZetaNeta>  yeah, thats why i wish people will lose the ability to
               write unreadable code
    <rindolf>  ZetaNeta: and there's also
               https://github.com/kripken/emscripten which compiles from
               C/C++/ObjC/etc. to unreadable JS.
    <rindolf>  ZetaNeta: how will you guarantee that?
   <ZetaNeta>  I cant. Thats why i wish
    <rindolf>  ZetaNeta: have you heard of the
               http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem ?
    <rindolf>  ZetaNeta: it may be impossible for a computer to do.
    <rindolf>  ZetaNeta: if not for a human too.
    <rindolf>  ZetaNeta: don't wish for the impossible.

               stuff.

               casts many doubts about a machine's (or a human's) ability

               is easy to understand or not, and so you might as well
               forget about it.

      <rindolf>  Hi all.
       <Bucket>  hi rindolf
      <rindolf>  Lately, I have been thinking that maybe some of the
                 Snowden leaks are actually the "achievements" of maniacal
                 minds ( https://duckduckgo.com/Mania ) and don't work
                 well in practise or at all.
      <rindolf>  Probably most of the NSA workers are either depressive,
                 maniacal or schizophrenic by now.
      <rindolf>  Althir: awesome.

      <rindolf>  Is Bucket a bot?
       <Bucket>  no, I'm a folk singer

 <flyingferret>  Certainly not.

                 you're alive? ;-)
      <rindolf>  I wouldn't , but not sure I can resist.
       <Althir>  rindolf: Chuck Norris only convinces people they are
                 deceased.
      <rindolf>  Althir: heh.
      <rindolf>  Althir: what about SGlau?

She and I watch it almost every week together.

SMG: We’ve got a lot of time for that. OK: it was 1997-1998ish, Buffy started
airing and became a cult series. So, one day a group of yeshivah pupils from a
local Chabad yeshivah arrived to the studios saying they have some
numerological insights from the Jewish bible, about what will happen in
Sunnydale next.

[SGlau burst out laughing.]

SGlau: [calms down] Oh my God, that’s the craziest thing I have ever heard.

SMG: Anyway, we played along, and listened to what they had to say, and
actually got a few good ideas from that. Moreover, in one of the recesses, one
of the Yeshivah pupils asked me out, and I accepted.

So we went on a date.

SGlau: So you mean like the 1997ish Sarah Michelle Gellar, and a Yeshivah
pupil… On a date?!

SMG: Yes! And I actually had some weirder dates as a happy spinster.

Anyhow, surprisingly, it was a very nice date, I had a great time, and I
learned quite a bit.

SGlau: Heh.

SMG: And one thing he told me was that every Jew (as he said) should believe
they are the Messiah, which is something I treasured since.

SGlau: So I presume I’m also the Messiah?

SMG: You got it. We are the most powerful people on Earth, and we should aim
to bring the end of days.

A lot of people think that the proper way to achieve world domination is to
create an [architecture that will solve the whole world’s problems and then
some](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html). We’ve been
seeing quite a few of them since /Joel on Software/ wrote this article: Ruby,
Google Go, Node.js, Mozilla’s Rust, Clojure, Scala, Perl 6, etc. Some of them
have or will mature to something truly nice, or have inspired a lot of
features in other languages, but it’s hard for plain-old-single-you to compete
with them, and here is something interesting: not too many people want them.

What do people want? Chuck Norris/etc. factoids, lolcats and other captioned
images, funny cat videos, parodies of /My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic/
(♥), photos of attractive (or even not too attractive) men and women,
screencasts of games or other programs (including many open source programs),
photos of scenery, new and improved recipes for preparing food (and of course
- tasty food itself), new, old or renovated jokes, and some interesting tales
and anecdotes from your life. And naturally - programs that can will scratch
an itch - however small.

Some people told me that my solver for Freecell and other solitaire games,
simply called [Freecell Solver](http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/) is useless,
but it's not - it's just a niche program. And I received hundreds of E-mails
about it. Furthermore, given that Freecell is (or used to be) a big phenomenon
in Israel, where many boys and girls starting from the age of 18 found
themselves playing it on the [Israeli
military](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces) computers out of
boredom, then the fact that I have written a solver for it, has impressed many
people I talked with or met, including some attractive (both physically and
intellectually) young ladies, and they ended up asking me about how it was
written, and which algorithms it employed.

So Freecell Solver was one of my most successful programs, not despite being a
niche program, but because of it. Niche programs own. Not only that, but niche
everything is great. Many people whom I referred to [my
stories](http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/stories/) helped themselves to the
screenplay [Star Trek: “We, the Living
Dead”](http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/)
*because* it contained Star Trek in the name, and because there are quite a
few fans of the /Star Trek/ franchise and worlds.

The more of a niche artwork you write, the more a large subset of those who
like it, are likely to pay attention to it, try it out, and enjoy it. For more
information, see Eric Sink’s excellent and inspiring essay [“How to get people
talking about your product”](http://www.ericsink.com/articles/Buzz.html). For
example, [DuckDuckGo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckDuckGo) was originally
marketed as a search engine by Perl geeks, and for Perl geeks. It was a good
marketing decision because the Perl community is small, cohesive and is at a
good strategical position to influence other communities. Right now, many
people who are not Perl programmers, are using it, as well as, or even in
preference to Google, but choosing Perl was a good preliminary strategical
decision. We can expect that with the future growth of DuckDuckGo, that it
will use more performant technologies than Perl more and more, but it will
still owe some of its initial success to starting out as a Perl product.

[Selina is wearing a backpack full of various trip utilities and wears a pouch
bag, and approaches the cupboard of Mephiqoleth. She opens it. Mephiqoleth is
there.]

Mephiqoleth: I SEE YOU ARE READY, MAGEIA.

Selina: Yep! Got my traveller’s checks, some dollars, my mobile, my passport,
some water, some snacks, some sunscreen. Not sure if all that will help with
surviving The Amber, but I can always hope.

Mephiqoleth: I COULD HAVE USED MY CONJURING SPELLS TO CONJURE THEM FOR YOU.

Selina: Well, as someone who saw enough of your demons’ lot’s shenanigans,
*and* some episodes of Sabrina, there’s no way I will trust such magically
conjured goods.

Mephiqoleth: YOU MAY BE RIGHT. MAGIC CAN BE A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD.

BUT BACK TO BUSINESS. ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT ME TO TELEPORT YOU TO THE AMBER?

Selina: Positive. Do your worst!

Mephiqoleth: Fair enough.

[Mephiqoleth raises his hands and says in Hebrew, as the Hebrew letters (in
the modern Hebrew alphabet) appear on the highlighted floor, with a darkened
room and the Hebrew letters of the spoken message expand outward.]

Mephiqoleth: אלוהי אברהם, יצחק ויעקב, שגר את באפי מאגיה, הקוטלת, אל… [ The god
of Abraham, Yitzhak and Yaakov, please teleport Buffy Mageia, The Slayer, to…

Selina: Whoa.

[The bell rings and many school kids are walking out of the classroom,
including Selina. She has an empty hour. As she walks in the hallway, she is
sometimes greeted by “Hi, Selina!”, “What’s new?”, etc. and answers briefly.
She finds Jessica and Jonathan standing next to Jessica’s locker and
approaches them.]

Selina: Oh, there you are. Hi Jess, hi Jon.

Jessica: Selina! I see you’ve survived History class.

Selina: Yeah, I’ll take it one lesson at a time, I guess.

[Jonathan hugs Selina from the side and eventually leaves.]

Selina: So how are you two love-birds?

Jessica: Oh, this and that, discussing computers endlessly as usual.

Selina: [ Sarcastically ] Geeks!

Jessica: Heh, like you’re not a geek too.

Selina: I is!

Jessica: And we is too.

Selina: True.

Selina: This reminds me. I really should update my Mandriva system at home. I
have not in several days, now. And to think I originally had my friend Aaron
install Mandrake Linux for me, because I thought it was cool that it was
called the same as my last name.

Jessica: Heh, maybe you should become Selina Mandriva now.

Jonathan: Or Selina Mageia.

[Selina bursts out laughing.]

Selina: That sounds like a name of a vampire slayer… or a vampire.

Jonathan: Or both.

Selina: Yeah. I told you about how I was nicknamed “Puffy” and then “Buffy”
during one summer camp, right?

Jessica: Yes, many times.

Selina: Yeah, I found it amusing at the time. For a while afterwards, I
insisted that my friends call me “Buffy” until I realised it was silly, and
reverted back to “Selina”.

Jessica: Anyway, I’m off to gym.

Selina: Bye, love you.

[Selina is reading a book and says to herself out loud]

Selina: Selina “Buffy” Mandrake. *The* Slayer. I like the sound of it.

I don’t remember whose idea it was, but we ended up enrolling Eve into the
Homecoming Queen contest. When Eve discovered she was on the nominees list,
she was a bit upset.

“Homecoming Queen? Me? Why would I ever want to be a homecoming queen?”

“Eve, we thought you could see how beautiful you are, and how much people
could like you, if they got to know you.” I answered.

“Hah! Well… oh heck, I don’t have a ready reply. But I’m going to get you guys
for this. I really will.” and she started to walk from there. “You’ll see.”

Eve showed up to the homecoming queen nominees roundup, wearing one of her
best dresses. When her turn came, she began her speech:

“Ladies and Gentlemen. I don’t know how many of you know me, but my name is
Eve Siegel. I urge you to vote for me for homecoming queen, not for your sake,
but for mine. I really need you to vote for me, because my entire future
depends on it. Seriously.”

“Take a look at my Résumé, for example. ‘Experienced in computers and
programming since 1994.’ ; ‘Experienced in Linux and UNIX technologies since
1998’ ; ‘2000-2005 - Debian Packager’, ‘2005-Present - Mandrake Packager’, and
more of this vain. Tell me, who will take a second look at this C.V. if it did
not say, ‘2005 - Elected as a homecoming queen.’?”

“Now for what I’m going to do if I’m elected. I’m going to erect a gigantic
statue of Tux the Penguin, this guy [picture showing on the screen], and also
one for Beastie the BSD Daemon, [picture showing] for good measure. I’m going
to fight against abusive behaviour toward nerds and geeks, for computer
literacy, and… for world peace. What the heck!”

“But all these philanthropical causes are secondary to my egoistical motives
of having to win this title for my own good. Thank you!”

She practically brought down the house with this speech. Even Taylor and I
could not resist a maniacal laughter. She ended up being one of the five
finalists. As the elections were on, Eve started her own campaign sloganed
“Don’t vote for Eve!” and gave away pamphlets with nothing but raves about the
other four contestants. This also increased her karma considerably.

She wore the same dress during the homecoming queen ceremony, as during the
pre-election. As the runner-ups were announced, she was given warm hugs from
all-of-them. She ended up being the first runner-up with a margin of only 5
votes to the real winner. She ended up saying she was glad she did not take
the title, but I never saw her happier than on that day.

She did not put it in her résumé.

When Eve and I got together to go shopping, we went to a clothes shop. “You
know, my newfound powers are intoxicating. Three guys hit on me at school
since the weekend, including this really cute Football player.” she said.

“Hmmm… ” I said.

“Are you ladies alright?” the shop’s clerk (Tim, a young and handsome man)
approached us.

“Hey Tim!” I said, “I don’t believe you know my friend Eve here.”

“Eve Siegel!” she said and extended her hand.

“Tim O’Brian.” he said and they shook hands. “OK, I’ll be there if you need
me…”

Eve followed him with her gaze for a few seconds, and then smiled and went
back to looking at the clothes.

“Will you stop that?” I whispered to her.

“Stop what?” she said.

“You’re totally into him.”

“So I’m lusting him a little bit, so what? ‘But I say unto you, that whosoever
looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already
in his heart.’”

“Well, girlfriend, committing adultery in your heart is perfectly harmless and
quite rewarding. And I’m not really raping anyone. I’m tenderly making love to
them.”

“Listen,” I snapped at her, “Taylor is my best friend, and I swear that if
you…”

“I’m crazy about Taylor.” she interrupted me.

“What?” I said.

She changed her pose. “I’m crazy about Taylor. Always have been. I promise I
wouldn’t do anything to hurt him.”

“You always have been crazy about Taylor? Why didn’t you tell him that?”

“Come on, have you looked at me then? I wasn’t his type. He always dated these
well-groomed girls, who had some sense not to rebel like I did. Hell, he also
dated this incredibly dumb cheerleader once.”

“Stacie wasn’t dumb!”

“I was being sarcastic! My point is that he was way out of my league.”

“Oh!” I said and tried to hug her.

“No hug!” she said. “In any case, I’ll do my best to make things work between
Taylor and I. And even if they don’t, we’ll remain good friends. The kind of
friends who go to movies together, or socialise at LUG meetings, fix dates for
each other, etc.”

“Good, I’m glad to hear that. Now where were we?”

“Picking clothes.” she said, and after a while added: “You know, we should
drop by Radio Shack and get some dolls of Tux and Beastie the BSD Daemon. I
totally dig these guys. Oh! And a nice Looney Toons poster. I’d hate to pump
money into the MPAA’s lawsuit machine, but I really like Marvin the Martian.”

“Who are you, and what have you done to Erisa?”

“Hey, the makeover was your idea, Jennifer. What have *you* done to Erisa?”
and we both laughed.

“Hi Taylor!” we said one after the other.

“Hey guys, ” he said, “what are you guys doing here?”

“Helping Erisa get ready for her date.” I said.

“I’ll get her.” Amanda said, and went up the stairs.

“Don’t you think you look a bit plain for the date?” I asked.

“Well, it’s only a movie and a pizza. Plus, there’s no way on Earth that Erisa
is going to look better than I am.”

“Holy virgin mother of god!” exclaimed Jeff. He was looking at the staircase
where Erisa stood, descending it slowly. Her jet-black hair was arranged in a
ball and a pony tail, shining from the light. Her dark purple dress made her
look especially beautiful, and complemented her body. She looked wonderful.

“So, ” she said after she reached the ground floor, shaking her body and
extending her hands, “how do I look?”

“You look… ” Taylor said, “divine!”

Erisa thought for a moment and then said: “‘Divine’s good.”

“Here, Erisa…”

“Hey, ‘Erisa’ was the old (and temporary) me. Call me ‘Eve’ now.”

“…Eve! Here - I brought you flowers.” and he handed her the flowers he had.

Eve (!) smelled them, and said, “they smell nice. Mum, can you put them in a
vase with some water?”

“Ahhmm… Eve, can we stop by my house and give me a chance to pick up some
better clothes?”

“Why?” Eve said, “we’re going to miss the movie.”

“Well, people will look at the two of us and say: ‘she is *way* out of his
league!’”

Eve approached Taylor. “Well, to quote Richard P. Feynman, ” she said as she
tied her arms around his neck “‘What do you care what other people think?’ We
both know you’re a great guy and I’m so lucky to go on a date with you.
Mwaaa…” and she kissed him on the cheek.

“Well, ” he said, “I guess we’d better get going. Bye all!”

“Bye!” we all said. Eve and Taylor left and Taylor gave us a thumb’s up as he
left, and we gave him back.

 <whatsyourname>  hey rindolf
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: hi.
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: what's your name? ;-)
 <whatsyourname>  rindolf: i met you a couple of times in #programming
                  years ago
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: ah, I vaguely remember it and can also
                  grep my logs.
 <whatsyourname>  what brought you to ##english channel anyway?
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: you're welcome .
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: I'm here on autojoin, but often just
                  lurking.
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: thing is - I cannot sleep yet today - too
                  many high thoughts.
 <whatsyourname>  rindolf: I see
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: do you mind if I share these thoughts
                  with you?
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: here on the channel?
       <rindolf>  And he left.
 <whatsyourname>  rindolf: i don't mind
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: OK.
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: I have a short essay (maybe a Google+
                  post) called "Play to lose"
 <whatsyourname>  When did you write it?
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: where I say that you can learn more from
                  a match/fight/argument/etc. that you lose than one that
                  you won.
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: I didn't write it yet.
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: but i'd like to - sorry for being
                  unclear.
 <whatsyourname>  okay
 <whatsyourname>  please continue
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: thing is - it was believed that
                  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee is the best
                  combat fighter in history, and Chuck Norris is the
                  second best one.
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: now at the moment Norris is losing quite
                  a few fights, but part of it is due to him being past
                  his prime and with a malfunctioning left leg.
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: but my pet theory is that many of the new
                  age fighters could have beaten both Chuck Norris and
                  Bruce Lee (who has since passed away unfortunately) in
                  their prime, at least some of the time.
 <whatsyourname>  Okay
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: and it's also possible that in this day
                  and age if we take Joe and Martin who are two superb
                  mixed martial artists (MMAs) then it's possible that
                  sometimes Joe will win and sometimes Martin.
 <whatsyourname>  Yeah
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: moreover, the ancient Hebrew word for
                  fighting or warfare has other more positive connotations
                  : Bread (Lechem), soldering (Lehalchim - as in
                  electronics), etc.
 <whatsyourname>  Well, that's very interesting
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: the root Ch.R.b/bh is reserved for
                  destruction and a sword is called "Cherev".
 <whatsyourname>  Hehe
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: maybe it's similar to the greek mythology
                  conception of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena as
                  noble and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares as violent
                  and destructive.
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: my point is that there are many other
                  ways to fight aside from combat.
 <whatsyourname>  okay
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: and the fighting I'm really good at is at
                  writing essays, stories, humour, etc. (which also convey
                  serious messages in hopefully amusing ways).
 <whatsyourname>  i see
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: anyway, I decided that I encourage people
                  to tell me why they think my stories sucked.
       <rindolf>  So I can improve in the future.
 <whatsyourname>  you should go about writing it
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname:
                  http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Emma-Watson-applying-for-a-software-dev-job/
                  - someone told me he didn't like that, and after I asked
                  him for the specifics, gave me a detailed analysis, and
                  I realised he was right and improved it.
 <whatsyourname>  i'm glad to hear that
       <rindolf>  Part of the original problem there was that that Emma
                  Watson expressed herself in a manner that is unfit for
                  an educated and intellectual Britishwoman who, on top of
                  it, has graduated from English Literature from Brown
                  University (which is a prestiguous school.).
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: Yaakov on #perl said that he forgot how
                  to speak English properly, because he doesn't know which
                  words are common and which are not.
 <whatsyourname>  rindolf: what's his native language?
       <rindolf>  I have a huge problem with English vocabulary, but maybe
                  it's actually better for non-native speakers of English
                  (Which still sometimes ask me for clarification or "What
                  that words means?").
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: I think it's English. He's an American
                  religious Jew.
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: I'm an Israeli secular Jew.
 <whatsyourname>  rindolf: I see
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: I think I'll just prepare a fortune
                  cookie out of this conversation and call it a day.
 <whatsyourname>  Sure
       <rindolf>  I'm too lazy to write a proper essay and people may
                  equally appreciate reading an IRC log.
      <Somelauw>  rindolf: Just looking a bit at your essay. "but we
                  decided to give you a chance anyway". Here you miss the
                  opportunity to come up with a good humorous motivation
                  to interview her.
       <rindolf>  Somelauw: heh.
       <rindolf>  Somelauw: well, I don't feel strongly about it.
       <rindolf>  Somelauw: maybe they can say that they figured out it
                  will be good publicity for their firm.

[Becky and Chankey are sitting in the library, studying together, and
listening to Cimorelli - “When I’m gone” . Faith approaches them.]

Faith: Hmm... hi kids! That doesn’t sound exactly like Anna Kendrick.

Whoa, who are all those girls?

Becky: Oh, they are Cimorelli - six sisters who sing together. They are a big
hit on YouTube.

Faith: Six sisters!

Chankey: And they also have some brothers.

Faith: Heh, God bless their mother. After my third pregnancy (to twins) I
said: “That’s it. No way, José!”.

I would think their being a big family is part of their charm.

Chankey: Yes, and the way I see it: all the power to them. See: I read 20,000
Leagues Under the Sea as a child, and I ended up memorising the English
translation and now the French original, because I liked it so much.

Anyway, Captain Nemo there, thinks he’s a nobody, which is what “Nemo” means
in Latin, but he's not. Thing is: lots of people expressed interest in him due
to his various unique qualities, and he kept thinking: “They are interested in
tangential stuff, not in the real me. They don't know the real me.”

And here's the thing: all these qualities are what make you who you are, and
you should exploit them and be yourself.

Faith: Indeed!

while some people seem to have better talent for some things from an early age
(or what you call "age"), many great artists worked hard to acquire it.
Furthermore, hard work can and should be a lot of fun, and it's important to
also "Have a life" and eat&drink well ("Wine"), enjoy the company of people of
any sex ("Women") and have clean , creative, recreational fun, however
amateuristic or lame ("Song").

I've started writing about all that in [an
essay](http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/)
on my site which I called “Putting All Cards on the Table (2013)” and now I
wish to combine it, with some newer and older insights into “Putting Many
Cards on the Table (2015)” which will likely need to be updated in upcoming
years as well.

Like the old (and wise) adage goes: “The best time to plant a tree was 100
years ago. The second best time to plant a tree is now”. What it implies in
this context is that the earlier you start honing a skill, the sooner you will
become better at it.

Anyway, what I suggest you do is go outside and socialise more: talk to people
with dogs ("Hi! Nice dog! How is he called? How old is he? What kind of dog is
it? What's *your* name? What do you do?") , interesting shirts, tattoos, etc.
Also - make sure to talk to shop clerks, shop vendors, waiters/waitresses,
barmen, baristas, etc..

One thing I learned from
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratatouille_%28film%29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratatouille_%28film%29)
is that "Everyone can cook", or do most other stuff that was shown to be
possible. Furthermore, contrary to popular belief (action) heroism is about
bending the rules, and finding you own unique, resourceful and ingenius,
"hacky" way to do things like David used a sling to shoot goliath instead of
using a spear to fight him and most likely dying. My essay has [a
section](http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#david_and_goliath)
about why David was an action hero and a "hacker", in a broad definition of
the word.

Another advice I can give you is to accept the fact that you're depressed and
be content. It's OK to be depressed, like this episode of Simsons illustrates:
[http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Moaning_Lisa](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Moaning_Lisa)
. Also, one of the the best ways to be happy is to be content with what you
have and who you are and accept and love yourself. "He who has more is not
happier than he who is content with less.".

Finally, I've recently been tweeting a lot (see my feed at
[https://twitter.com/shlomif/with_replies](https://twitter.com/shlomif/with_replies)
) about [Darwinian
Fitness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_%28biology%29) which I believe
is manifested in humans in (sexual) attractiveness, a.k.a: "hot"ness (which is
not the same as beauty and I believe is more important), and which has a very
good and positive correlation with competence a.k.a what Marx referred to as
"able" in his [“From each according to his ability, to each according to his
need”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_each_according_to_his_ability%2C_to_each_according_to_his_need)
slogan.

Now, this fitness/attractiveness is not the same as the so-called [Physical
fitness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness) and as I contemplated
on a tweet,

can get more and better dates when in a cranky mood, than the buffest obscure
female body builder/"fitness" competitor on a good day.», and that's because
they are more (biologically) fit. Moreover, in British slang "fit" came to
mean a sexually desirable MOTAS regardless of how athletic he or she is.

If you still want to lose weight then I suggest following my variation on
Maimonides' advice for dieting. Namely:

1. Eat well, and eat what you feel like and want to.

2. Don't eat in haste - eat in comfort and enjoy your meal.

3. Eat according to the stomach - not according to the eye.

4. Eat until you're 75% full - not until you're 100% full (and can't eat
another bite).

5. A bit minor, but my father kept eating food along with extra bread, so
he'll feel more full, but I think it has an adversary effect.

Finally, there was [this Slashdot
feature](http://science.slashdot.org/story/09/12/06/2228210/how-men-and-women-badly-estimate-their-own-intelligence)
which claimed that most men and women claimed that their male relatives were
more intelligent than their female ones, and I believed the problem is that
men and boys tend to be more *confident* than women and girls (or used to at
least), and that implies taking more chances, being more sloppy, allowing
yourself to make mistakes, and accepting the fact that some people will
dislike you. After a while, I saw this music video by Christina Grimmie which
has the very same theme, and this pet theory of mine was reinforced:

  <errgnomeous>  rindolf: you don't like hot sweaty male love?
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: I'll sleep with this boy if you sleep with
                 Jennifer Lawrence and let me watch the sex tape. ;-)
                 Lesbian sex is hawt!
     <misspwn_>  rindolf, or or you can just do what makes you happy :P
     <misspwn_>  i'm not going to become a lesbian for convenience of
                 others sorry
  <errgnomeous>  what if eating skittles naked while sitting in a hot tub
                 and watching netflix is what makes you happy?
       <Delver>  do whatever you can get by with. whomever it is. don't be
                 too selective
     <misspwn_>  because then i'll have to stop shaving my armpits and
                 become a vegan and read old articles from gloria steinem
       <Delver>  it hurts later
     <misspwn_>  yeah, you'll end up like joan rivers on life support, and
                 no one truly wants that
     <misspwn_>  mine worked
       <Delver>  there are 2 homeless copules and a single woman camping
                 near me
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: heh, so much for stigma.
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: I've met many really cool Lesbians.
     <misspwn_>  rindolf, :P stigma is for the birds, son
     <misspwn_>  i also have pretty awesome lesbian friends
      <rindolf>  And I think homosexuality is a spectrum.
     <misspwn_>  they aren't all supre feminazi-hambeasts
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: that's nice.
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: that's great.
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: so you'ra a girl who uses the term "Feminazi"?
                 I tend to say "cynical feminism" which is less ambiguous.
      <rindolf>  I acknowledge the existence of non-cynical feminism (e.g:
                 My Little Pony).
     <misspwn_>  rindolf, for me personally it's the whole 3rd wave
                 feminist movement i cannot stand so the term feminazi
                 seems to fit the bill
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: ah, OKO.
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: how many waves were there?
      <rindolf>  Which wave is Buffy? I cannot remember.
     <misspwn_>  well unless it turns into 4th reich, i believe there is
                 only 3
     <misspwn_>  rindolf, i don't think your average stereotypical 3rd
                 wave feminist truly appreciates what the previous women
                 have accomplished for them
     <misspwn_>  it's a circle jerk of men bashing
     <misspwn_>  er i should say truly does not appreciate @ rindolf
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_power -
                 apparently Buffy is 3rd wave feminism.
     <LadyTr0n>  what other circle jerk could you possibly be referring
                 to?
     <LadyTr0n>  men hating on men
     <LadyTr0n>  and masturbating
       <Delver>  actually it's good to male bash. it's one of the freedoms
                 that women earned
     <LadyTr0n>  no bueno
      <rindolf>  Xena was an awfully feminist (and unrealistic and
                 comical) heroine, but I can retrospectively say she was
                 awesome.
     <misspwn_>  Delver, possibly, but i feel some take it too far
       <Delver>  of course
      <rindolf>  Lucy Lawless who played her: 1. Also had starred in some
                 Oceanian porn films before doing Xena. 2. Cried in her
                 wedding.
     <misspwn_>  and i'm not oppressed when i make my bf a sandwich
                 either. i like to cook
       <Delver>  just like men take this silly "mens rights" backlash into
                 dumb directions
     <misspwn_>  yep
       <Delver>  as long as we find a happy median
       <Delver>  too bad we only get one life to fuck up
     <misspwn_>  you get your all or nothing groups in all categories
       <Delver>  or maybe just as well
      <rindolf>  Lots of people couldn't imagine Xena (the character)
                 crying at her wedding.
  <errgnomeous>  actually there's an infinite amount of lives we just
                 don't realize it
     <misspwn_>  it's just a shame you have the ones who are the moldy
                 slice of bread in the package
     <misspwn_>  it just spreads
      <rindolf>  Buffy was a different matter altogether - she cried
                 sometimes.
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: I'm a 37 years old man who can cook only very
                 simple things like pasta - not too politcally correct, I
                 know.
     <misspwn_>  rindolf, you get as much you put in
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: recently https://twitter.com/BarRefaeli tweeted
                 about the fact that she started cooking and her Tsculent
                 (with chicken!) looked yumyum.
     <misspwn_>  if you only put just the tip in, someone is going to be
                 disappointed
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: yes, my parents and sisters are excellent
                 cooks, but I lack the time and energy for cooking.
      <rindolf>  I enjoy eating food (naturally) but don't mind going to
                 eat it in a restaurant.
       <Delver>  I ate vegetable straws all evening
       <Delver>  mildly nauseated
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: on the plane back home my father and I met a
                 man who couldn't even cook pasta (which I can).
     <misspwn_>  yikes
      <rindolf>  Delver: ah , maybe eat something else.
     <misspwn_>  one thing i've never made and would like to master is
                 beef wellington
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: he was an amazing man though, and resembled
                 both my father and me.
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: ah.
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: my mother doesn't taste the food while cooking
                 it and still usually gets good results. They recently got
                 many good ideas from T.V. or the Internet, etc.
       <Delver>  LadyTr0n, keep on hangin in there
     <misspwn_>  rindolf, that's me, hasn't really failed yet except for
                 some couscous with spinach that had far too much lemon
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: ah.
     <misspwn_>  earthy lemony overload yikes
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: I'm OK with couscous.
     <misspwn_>  couscous is great!
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: I prefer rice or pasta or noodles or tabulah or
                 whatever though.
       <Delver>  I need some righteous manhate songs ladies. post it!

     <misspwn_>  i've met richard stallman

Mosheh Ben-Amram: [ on IM ] Hello, Selina! How are you doing, today?

Selina: I’m fine. Trying to contribute to the Hebrew Wikipedia. These Affixes
are driving me crazy.

Mosheh Ben-Amram: Heh, עברית קשה שפה, but there are worse.

Mosheh Ben-Amram: האם את מדברת עברית? [ = “Do you speak Hebrew?” ]

Selina: Qtsath, or as new speakers will say Qetsath. Heh.

Mosheh Ben-Amram: Yes, one of the first words you have to learn to say, and
it’s already a Shibboleth.

Selina: Emeth. [ = "True." ]

BTW, are you actually Mosheh Ben-Amram (= Moses) the Hebrew prophet?

Mosheh Ben-Amram: I won’t deny that I am.

Selina: Hah!

Mosheh Ben-Amram: There are quite a few other people called “Mosheh Ben-Amram”
in the Israeli phone directory.

Selina: Yes, I can imagine that.

Actually, judging by recent happenings, learning Hebrew may be the least my
problems.

Mosheh Ben-Amram: Anything you’d like to talk about?

Selina: No, I don’t expect you to believe me, anyway. Any more than the amount
that I’ll believe you if you told me you were actually the Jewish prophet.

Mosheh Ben-Amram: Yes, well, I have some business to tend to. Good luck with

A lecture or two ago, when Guy Keren was saying that linux would never ever be
a gaming platform i tried to point out he was wrong, and it's actually doing
OK, and everyone looked at me like i'm crazy.

>>>

Some rules of thumb I tweeted about recently:

1. If someone tells you something is impossible and you can't do it, it
probably can be done.

2. If someone tells you something will *surely* never happen, it likely can
happen.

3. If someone tells you are an idiot and are definitely wrong, then you
probably uncovered an [Elephant in the
Room](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_in_the_room) and are right. Also
see [“Encourage criticism and try to get
offended”](http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/).

In general, people who are sure of themselves are probably wrong, as I am not
even sure of the [Aristotlean
Logic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle#Logic) which got us incredibly
far.

Back when I was in the 9th grade, during a Physics lesson, one of my
classmates complained to the teacher that something we were learning was too
hard. So my teacher asked her “Do you see people with picket baskets outside?”
and she answered no. And then he said “Well, then you should know that life is
no picnic!”.

         <rindolf>  bkeys: sup?
           <bkeys>  Messing with docker still
           <bkeys>  I hate it but there is no better option
           <bkeys>  yourself?
         <rindolf>  bkeys: I fixed Freecell Solver on ARM linux.
         <rindolf>  bkeys: turns out "char"s in C are unsigned there by
                    default.
           <bkeys>  I thought this was always the case
         <rindolf>  bkeys: they are signed on x86
           <bkeys>  I did not know this
 <ExpiredPopsicle>  Protip: uint8_t and int8_t exist. Use them. :P
         <rindolf>  bkeys: ah.
           <bkeys>  I almost never use chars directly
         <rindolf>  ExpiredPopsicle: I know
           <bkeys>  Most of the time C++ data structures are good enough
 <ExpiredPopsicle>  Sign extending a char to an int can ruin your day.
           <bkeys>  Then ints and floats
       <BlackMoon>  rindolf: so you actually have to type signed char? :)
       <BlackMoon>  weird.
 <ExpiredPopsicle>  Or you could just use int8_t.
       <BlackMoon>  neverah
         <rindolf>  BlackMoon: yes
       <BlackMoon>  you can take my poorly defined types from my cold,
                    dead, typedefed hands
 <ExpiredPopsicle>  pfft
         <rindolf>  BlackMoon: or use the -fsigned-char compiler flag
       <BlackMoon>  'build procedure: use more obscure flags'
 <ExpiredPopsicle>  -O9999999999999999999999999999999999
       <BlackMoon>  -O911
 <ExpiredPopsicle>  Performance problems solved!
       <BlackMoon>  activate emergency optimizations!
 <ExpiredPopsicle>  Also I accidentally made the optimizer sentient. We're
                    all doomed.
       <BlackMoon>  nah we'r find just so long as.. oh, you showed it some
                    of your source code too? Well no wonder it wants to
                    end all human life
 <ExpiredPopsicle>  You know how the optimizer figures out how some code
                    is unneeded and just deletes it?
 <ExpiredPopsicle>  It did that with humans.
       <BlackMoon>  or stuffed us all into a lib somewhere, never to be
                    linked with again
 <ExpiredPopsicle>  We have been simplified down to a 32-bit constant:
                    0x4655434B
                 *  rindolf survived
       <BlackMoon>  I will not be typecast!
       <BlackMoon>  I am a cHuman! NOT A NUMBER! AND DEFINATELY NOT A
                    VOID*
         <Type-21>  >DEFINATELY
       <BlackMoon>  I hope the compilers come for you first Type-21
         <Type-21>  i'm already lost
         <Type-21>  the compilers are flowing through me
       <BlackMoon>  resistance is futile, you will be compil error on line
                    53, invalid type-21
        <BlackFox>  I'm defiantly a void
                 *  rindolf got transpiled into JavaScript
         <Type-21>  aren't the kids these days doing coffescript or
                    typescript or something?

 <rindolf>  Hi all
 <rindolf>  Sup?
     <Zuu>  Hi rindolf and Thymo :>
     <Zuu>  Merry weekend :>
 <rindolf>  Zuu: hi
     <Zuu>  How goes it?
 <rindolf>  Zuu: fine - working on cpan modules
   <Thymo>  Hey.
 <rindolf>  Zuu: perls before swine
   <Thymo>  Is GitHub up for you guys?
 <rindolf>  Thymo: it was a while ago
     <Zuu>  rindolf, do you happen to know if theres some sort of perl to
            C transformer tool?
     <Zuu>  there's this exif tool written in perl, and it's just nuts
            that its not in C :P
 <rindolf>  Zuu: you can embed Perl code in C code
     <Zuu>  ofcourse, if i wanted to have the entire interpreter on board
     <Zuu>  anyways, i take it as a "no, i dont know of such a thing" :)
   <Thymo>  status.github.com
   <Thymo>  They just got a major outage.
     <Zuu>  ouch
   <Thymo>  Server availability just dropped to 0%.
     <Zuu>  maybe the student worker accidentally altered the DNS records
            :P
   <Thymo>  It had major outages yesterday.
     <Zuu>  Maybe they have two student workers :P
     <Zuu>  Or DoS...
   <Thymo>  The servers are still up. They're serving a 503 page.
     <Zuu>  or government attack :O
     <Zuu>  no, wait! The aliens have landed!
 <rindolf>  Zuu: heh
     <Zuu>  or maybe little bobby 0; DROP TABLES; -- have visited
   <Thymo>  SSH is still up.
   <Thymo>  But hangs as soon as it connects.
         *  Zuu starts playing the intro theme for X-Files
     <Zuu>  Thymo, We've got to solve this mystery
   <Thymo>  Let's ping -f them to see when they'll get back up. :p
     <Zuu>  i will help by making fun of things :>
     <Zuu>  to make sure we're doing a reliable ping, i think we need to
            ping it from several places
     <Zuu>  say... from a large scale botnet
 <rindolf>  Zuu: heh
     <Zuu>  you know... to see if it has come up yet :P
 <rindolf>  Zuu: you've been making me laugh now
     <Zuu>  :D
     <Zuu>  Welcome to ##Fun :>

 <funnynickname>  oh shit.. so close
          <hlve>  OH COE ON.
         <foddo>  aw shit, i was early
       <deepend>  dang
     <radiofree>  that's what she said
       <rindolf>  foddo: "Hello! My name is foddo and I was early for
                  11:11 today," "Hello foddo! We all love you."
         <foddo>  rindolf: stop rubbing it in
         <foddo>  you're a horrible person
       <deepend>  s/in/
    <reddit-bot>  Correction, <foddo> rdolf: stop rubbg it
       <deepend>  s/stop/don't stop
    <reddit-bot>  Correction, <foddo> rdolf: don't stop rubbg it
         <foddo>  rubbg
         <foddo>  rdolf.
       <deepend>  rubbg me good
       <deepend>  rndlfo
         <foddo>  rdolf the rubbg redeer
       <rindolf>  foddo: but I'm trying to win the Nobel prize for being a
                  horrible person…
         <foddo>  i'm fairly sure you're not going to win that one.
       <rindolf>  foddo: it's one of my most coveted life achievements
       <rindolf>  foddo: why not?
         <foddo>  i mean you'll have to up your horrible game somewhat
                  dramatically
       <rindolf>  foddo: so I'm not as horrible as humanly possible?
                  That's quite an insult
         <foddo>  i, also, am working my way up the chain.
       <rindolf>  foddo: nice

    <Hans>  > I’ll have to get to the bottom of those unreliable read
            operations. But this is looking *very* promising
    <Hans>  > /dev/null is web scale, we heard, and it supports sharding!
 <shlomif>  heheh
 <shlomif>  have I shown you
            http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-sharp-programming-dev-null-is-webscale
            ?
    <Hans>  nope,
 <shlomif>  and
            http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-perl-nosql-dev-null
    <Hans>  ```how to properly secure it against abuse, so it will only
            null what you send to it. Not anything external and
            unsolicited.``` - sounds good
 <shlomif>  I should start a page on my wiki collecting links to the
            /dev/null is webscale meme
    <Hans>  >/dev/null has handled zettabytes of write-only data
            flawlessly
    <Hans>  maybe ^^
 <shlomif>  there's also https://devnull-as-a-service.com/
    <Hans>  haha yeah
    <Hans>  but i dont like their setup,
    <Hans>  its not really scalable,
 <shlomif>  :-)
    <Hans>  https://i.imgur.com/N9Ajqcv.png
    <Hans>  yeah but really, nginx stores the entire request body, either
            in memory or on disk, before serving http 200
    <Hans>  that's not optimal!
    <Hans>  if you send a too-big-request-body to this server, you'll get
            a `Nginx: 413 Request Entity Too Large Error`
 <shlomif>  ah.
    <Hans>  do you see my point? :P
 <shlomif>  ah
 <shlomif>  nice analysis'
 <shlomif>  did you tell them about it?
    <Hans>  nope
 <shlomif>  ah
    <Hans>  maybe i should haha
    <Hans>  >mail: mail@devnull-as-a-service.com blog: noqqe.de twitter:
            @noqqe
 <shlomif>  nice
    <Hans>  (also, if you send with content-encoding: gzip/deflate/sdch,
            their setup will actually bother to use cpu DECOMPRESSING it,
            before discarding it)
 <shlomif>  ah, heh.

I want to create a programming language called “Multiply” so people can say “I
program in Go, Forth, and Multiply”.
