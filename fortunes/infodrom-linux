Once upon a time there was a DOS user who saw Unix, and saw that it was
good.  After typing cp on his DOS machine at home, he downloaded GNU's
Unix tools ported to DOS and installed them.  He rm'd, cp'd, and mv'd
happily for many days, and upon finding elvis, he vi'd and was happy.  After
a long day at work (on a Unix box) he came home, started editing a file,
and couldn't figure out why he couldn't suspend vi (w/ ctrl-z) to do
a compile.

ELF is the first rock group that Ronnie James Dio performed with back in

		-- Linus Torvalds announcing 2.0.27
%
AP/STT.  Helsinki, Dec 5th, 6:22 AM.  For immediate release.

In order to allay fears about the continuity of the Linux project, Linus
Torvalds together with his manager Tove Monni have released "Linus
v2.0", affectionately known as "Kernel Hacker - The Next Generation".

Linux stock prices on Wall Street rose sharply after the announcement;
as one well-known analyst who wishes to remain anonymous says - "It
shows a long-term commitment, and while we expect a short-term decrease
in productivity, we feel that this solidifies the development in the
long run".

Other analysts downplay the importance of the event, and claim that just
about anybody could have done it.  "I'm glad somebody finally told them
about the birds and the bees" one sceptic comments cryptically.  But
even the skeptics agree that it is an interesting turn of events.

Others bring up other issues with the new version - "I'm especially
intrigued by the fact that the new version is female, and look forward
to seeing what the impact of that will be on future development.  Will
"Red Hat Linux" change to "Pink Hat Linux", for example?"

Maybe it is time for the kernel development process to take a
cue from the Debian Project.  Debian development does not stop
when a release is frozen; the development and stabilization
processes go on in parallel.  Debian is no faster than the
kernel at producing new major releases, but those releases,
when the finally come, tend to be solid.  The continued
presence of an unstable release relieves the temptation to
throw inappropriate thing into the frozen version.

To take another example, back in potato's freeze when I was culling
the release critical bug list, I started off taking a fair degree of
care to include an explanation and to Cc the submitter so they knew
what was going on. About half the time it resulted in angry messages
from said submitter insisting that I was being stupid or lazy or
didn't care about good quality packages or whatever. After a couple of
exchanges of messages, it's usually possible to convince them that you
do know what you're talking about, but it just takes up way too much
time. These days, I just don't bother to Cc anyone.

As I see it, Debian GNU/Hurd can, at most, be a system that helps people

that Debian and GNU define 'Free Software' in a different way.
		-- Wouter Verhelst
%
I should have been more clear there: Debian's hurd-i386 port should do
so. The Hurd, of course, should do what it thinks or feels to be best; and

There is a complete GNU Operating System.

Debian distributes 3 different operating systems, GNU/Linux,
BSD and GNU.  Debian itself isn't an operating system.

When I install Debian(be it Linux/alpha, Linux/s390,
FreeBSD/arm), I want to know it functions like Debian,
with all of it's filesystem layouts and interface programs.
		-- Adam Heath
%
If Debian Linux/alpha, Debian FreeBSD/arm, and Debian hurd-i386
are all different, then what is the point of Debian?
		-- Adam Heath
%
Conversely, if Debian FreeBSD is identical to FreeBSD,
what's the point of Debian?

%
Maybe the Hurd people really do need an independent distribution,
one that's not associated with the Debian OS, so we won't continue
to confuse issues of Hurd technical purity with Debian conformance.
		-- Michael Stone
%
There appear to be people interested in each of these,
and choice is good, right?
		-- Michael Stone
%
Debian doesn't own/maintain the programs that made the OS,
it "only" (sorry for that term) packages them together,
so it's called a distribution.

libexec--common policy on file locations is exactly one

If you want to turn GNU/Linux in something which can run Hurd servers,
your pretty close to a GNU/Hurd system with a Linux microkernel.

You don't have to be involved, just apply common sense.

%
I have the right to think and say that, that's called
free speech.

I wanted to change Debian, but I walked to a wall of
arrogant closed-minded people with no time and those
people have all the power over Debian.
		-- Jeroen Dekkers
%
It's not that I want to fight against Debian.  I want to
cooperate, but I'm not going to give up my ideals for that.
		-- Jeroen Dekkers
%
People are just saying that Debian GNU/Hurd should be the
same as Debian GNU/Linux, as much as technically possible.
		-- Wouter Verhelst
%
You miss some very important thing in your naming. It's Debian
GNU/NetBSD, Debian GNU/Linux and Debian GNU(/Hurd). You see: GNU, GNU
and GNU. That's why I think it would be easier for Debian to follow
GNU standards. But if Debian doesn't want it, I don't care.
		-- Jeroen Dekkers
%
And that doesn't make any sense.  The other way around makes more
sense, because GNU/Linux is the fork of the GNU OS and GNU/Hurd
is the original OS.

You have no respect for or understanding of what we do.

...if I'm permitted to.  I can think of at least one prominent Debian
Developer who howls with outrage every time I dare bring the point up
for discussion.  This prominent developer also has a fairly close
association with the Debian Policy Manual, so that tool might be used as
a weapon against any efforts of mine in that endeavor.

		-- Branden Robinson
%
By the way, thanks for the colorful turn of phrase, which helps to
elevate the literacy level of this list over the tiresome "it sucks"
rhetoric of the Hurd threads, but it's common knowledge that your skin
is far, far thicker than you imply with your feigned umbrage.  Moreover,
you can give exactly as well as you can take, if not better, as you
just illustrated.
		-- Branden Robinson
%
I expect people to cooperate instead of ignoring what other people want. 
		-- Jeroen Dekkers
%
People who update the policy documents according to approved proposals
as tracked by the BTS do not have more or less "veto power" over
policy proposals than any other Debian developer.

What is preventing someone from porting something to Hurd?
Something other than GNU?
		-- Adam Heath
%
It's called Debian GNU/Hurd because Debian GNU
can be confused with Debian GNU/Linux.

GNU/Hurd == the GNU operating system, the GNU Hurd is the core of GNU.

Geez, all free software is nice to have.  Let's not get into pointless
arguments in which one free software project is trying to beat another

I consider GNU/Linux a fork [of GNU]. And that system has
275 distributions all inventing the wheel.

I think you'll find that Debian is far
more than the kernel that Linus wrote in '91.

I think you'll find that Linux is far bigger and widely used than Hurd.

%
Again, we're about choice, not enforced dogma.  I think we all
agree that you're looking for something other than Debian.
		-- Michael Stone
%
I think we need to be careful not to equate the Hurd with any particular
individual.  Whether Jeroen Dekkers chooses to work with Debian or not
should have no real impact on Debian's support for the Hurd port.

The Debian Hurd and BSD ports should first and foremost be Debian
systems, and policy-compliance is central to Debian's identity --
even when it would be more convenient to ignore it.

It's a guideline.  Policy has never said it was 100%.

I doubt the Hurd can fit in with the rest of Debian.

Who said anything about Linux?
This is *Debian* you must be compatible with.
		-- Adam Heath
%
The current standard is how Debian functions.
Hurd should be molded to fit Debian, not Debian molded to fit Hurd.

%
Modifying Debian to work with Hurd, means that *ALL* other ports
of Debian need to be modified.  Is that what you really want?

%
I am not surprised that you attempt to misdirect this pointless thread with
more pointlessness, by saying that this is an argument about Hurd and Linux.

The FHS says it's for "UNIX-like operating systems".
GNU isn't UNIX-like, you know what the acronym means.

What is the problem? Make it /lib/exec and it is FHS compliant *g*.
		-- Eduard Bloch
%
You are actually one of those problems, you are somebody who
downgrades grave bugs to wishlist because the Hurd is unreleased.

The problem is that binaries from *BSD won't run on Debian *BSD and we
have to change every GNU package and the GNU coding standards.

Debian is only GNU/Linux at the moment.  Being compatible
with Debian thus means being compatible of GNU/Linux.

I think it's too philosophical for Debian; most of them
are part of the open source movement and want to avoid
talking about freedom, philosophy and ideology.

%
<jlj> MS infiltrating Debian?  They surely named that operation 'Enduring Freedom'
		-- #Hurd

Ah!  I knew there was a reason we had the Debian Open Source Guidelines
(DOSG), that we're the only Linux distribution that doesn't acknowledge
GNU in its title, that we stuffed KDE into our distribution ASAP, GPL
violations or no GPL violations...it all makes sense now!
		-- Daniel Burrows
%
Just calling something free software doesn't mean you understand it.
		-- Jeroen Dekkers
%
Jeroen, why do you spend as much time on antagonizing your
audience as on convincing it?  It's not very helpful.
		-- Richard Braakman
%
The irony is that you [Jeroen] then turn around and
blame your failure to communicate on your audience.
		-- Richard Braakman
%
You keep saying that you're going to leave Debian.  I think it's
high time that you do so.  Every mail you still spend on this
thread will just do more damage to your cause.

own name and some GNU components are often used elsewhere.

If your idea is that the Debian package should not do anything that
upstream doesn't stamp with their seal of approval, then we need
someone to handle the job of maintaining the Debian package, since
you don't seem interested in that.
		-- Thomas Bushnell
%
I want to see GNU released before 2005.  That won't happen with Debian.

I expect people to cooperate instead of ignoring what other people
want. I can imagine that volunteers don't have the time to do
everything, but then they should allow other people to do the work.

A port of Debian is supposed to be a Debian system which runs on
another platform.  That means it's a policy-compliant system which is,
as far as is practical, the same as all the other ports of Debian.
		-- Andrew Suffield
%
The thing in the archive's "hurd-i386" section has never demonstrated
any interest in becoming a port of Debian. It appears to be an attempt
to create a different system which happens to run a wide selection of
Debian packages.
		-- Andrew Suffield
%
I can't think of a better use for a killfile than eliminating
mails which commonly contain no useful or interesting content.

I suggest that the "Hurd people" get an archive set up
somewhere at gnu.org, and create their new operating system.
Someday, somebody might port Debian to it.

Debian cabal philosophy: Ignore the problems, treat the
people talking about those problems as a fool.

Debian is Debian is Debian.  If Debian is ported to Linux, then Linux

There's a more general chicken-and-egg problem too: the FHS isn't

Heh.  It's well-documented in an unpublished document.

I've got to say that calling the Hurd section the ``GNU specific annex'',
is very confusing.  If you want to call an OS running the Hurd kernel
"GNU" then we need to drop "GNU/" from our released architectures.
Having "GNU" standards not apply to a "GNU/Linux" distribution is
ridiculously confusing.
		-- Anthony Towns
%
If there's to be a "Linux" specific annex, and a "GNU" specific annex,
why would you expect "Debian GNU/Linux" to follow the former but not
the latter?

What do you mean by this?  Don't dance around the issue.

Well, all I can say is that there are lots of crazy people on IRC.

In a world of NDA-bound business agreements, Debian is an open

can have a fully functional and usable operating system without
needing any proprietary code.

> Why are the kernel developers using non-free development tools anyway?

Because Linus Torvalds is on record as being a pure pragmatist (with a
rather short-term viewpoint) who doesn't give a damn about
free-as-in-freedom software. He is not a free software advocate, but
just a guy who wrote a Unix-like kernel for fun and released it under
GPL.

them don't work."

The Internet had its first big worm epidemic since Nimda: the Sapphire
Worm, aka SQL Slammer.  Normally, I wouldn't bother mentioning this
worm.  It's news, but there are no real lessons to learn from the
event.  But there's an interesting Microsoft twist.  During the days of
the attack, Microsoft tried to deflect any blame by claiming that they
issued a patch for the vulnerability six months previously, and that
the only affected companies were the ones who didn't keep their patches
up to date.  A couple of days later, news leaked that Microsoft's own
network was hit pretty badly by the worm because they didn't patch
their own network.

Writing/maintaining software is providing a service (even when
it's free).  You need to listen to your customers if you want to
learn what features they need and thereby improve your product.
Of course, the customer isn't _always_ right, and often they
suggest specific implementations which don't fit into the "grand
scheme", but it's the input of ideas which is important.  Even if
they seem at first to be "wrong", I've found it's always worth
thinking about them, even if you ultimate modify or reject them.

go by the hacker alias "elmo" and are guilty of virtually every crime
against buildd admins and new maintainers we can flame you for.  One of
these lives has a future, and one of them does not."

The KDE people really impressed me.  At one point one of them wanted to show me
how you can write simple javascripts to create full KDE apps or dock applets.
He didn't have it installed though, so he decided to download it from the net;
there was a compatibility problem with the binary, so he pulled the code from
CVS; he didn't want to wait for a long compile, so he decided to use the other
processors on the LAN, but to do that he needed icecream; he pulled that from CVS...
All this was done at a fast and furious pace, he had 10 or 12 shells running at
the same time, was bouncing between them; other developers stuck their heads in:
"which shell is patching...?"  Development in action.  It was cool.

<marvinalone> I just had a discussion w/ my roommate whether buffer overflows
     would be possible if the stack grows the non-x86 way, so i'm wondering...
<iluxa> In that case stack on MIPS grows for the most part horizontally, with
        slight curves up and downwards, depending on unerlying terrain
<ths> You have to use it carefully, otherwise you may bump into a call tree.

only do so, because the dog's owner has a broader goal than the dog.
