FWIW, I have a fairly large killfile that's built up over the years; but I
don't killfile fellow DD.  My two conditions for killfiling are:

- I'm reasonably certain they'll never write anything that's worth my time
  reading it, and
- they're impotent enough that I don't have to worry about the consequences
  of ignoring them

Well, every DD can upload to the archive, so there can certainly be
consequences from ignoring any of them completely. :)

I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LEGAL THEORY THAT WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS
ARE VALID ONLY IF THEY ARE PRESENTED WITH A STYLE OF TYPOGRAPHY THAT
MAKES IT ESPECIALLY UNLIKELY THAT ANY USER WILL EVER FEEL INCLINED TO
TRY TO READ THEM CAREFULLY, SUCH AS BY USING ALL-UPPERCASE LETTERS TO
MAKE THEM EFFECTIVELY UNREADABLE. PERHAPS THE PRESENCE OF LOWERCASE
LETTERS IN THIS PARAGRAPH IS JUST AN EDITING MISTAKE? SURELY IT CANNOT
BE MEANT TO READ THAT WAY IN THE FINAL LICENSE.

<joeyh> I think there are released ports less far behind :-/
%
<bdale> the more interesting idea I had early on was to go excerpt hunks of text from the writings of RMS, etc, so that vrms could do more than just report what was non-free... it could give you a real tongue-lashing, too.  to be totally whacked, it might be cool someday to get RMS, et al, to record some flaming and build a vrms-festival so you can get the full treatment.  :-)
<asuffield> hehe
<bdale> well, you get the idea, festival and audio playback being two possible approaches to the same end
<infinity> bdale : That would be incredibly disturbing.
<infinity> bdale : Especially in a cron job at 6:30 am. :)
<pasc> bdale: and when a system is completly non-free free, it would play the free software song
<bdale> infinity: particularly with the mixer call to max the volume first...  :-)
